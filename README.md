## Project Title: COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

### Project Description:
In this project, learners will build a data analysis and reporting notebook (or app) that tracks global COVID-19 trends. The project will analyze cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across countries and time. Learners will clean and process real-world data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), generate insights, and visualize trends using Python data tools. By the end, they’ll have a data analysis report with visuals and narrative insights, suitable for presentation or publishing.

### Project Objectives:
- Import and clean COVID-19 global data
- Analyze time trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations)
- Compare metrics across countries/regions
- Visualize trends with charts and maps
- Communicate findings in a Jupyter Notebook or PDF report

### Project Segments (Step-by-Step Guide)
#### 1. Data Collection
Goal: Obtain a reliable COVID-19 dataset.
##### Data Sources:
- Our World in Data COVID-19 Dataset (CSV & API)
- Johns Hopkins University GitHub Repository

Recommended for beginners: Use the cleaned CSV from Our World in Data (easy to load with pandas).
##### Action:
Download owid-covid-data.csv from the above link.
Save in your working folder.

#### 2. Data Loading & Exploration
Goal: Load the dataset and explore its structure.
##### Tasks:
Load data using pandas.read_csv().
Check columns: df.columns.
Preview rows: df.head().
Identify missing values: df.isnull().sum().
##### Tools:
pandas
##### Key columns:
date, location, total_cases, total_deaths, new_cases, new_deaths, total_vaccinations, etc.

#### 3. Data Cleaning
Goal: Prepare data for analysis.
##### Tasks:
Filter countries of interest (e.g., Kenya, USA, India).
Drop rows with missing dates/critical values.
Convert date column to datetime: pd.to_datetime().
Handle missing numeric values with fillna() or interpolate().
##### Tools:
pandas

#### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Goal: Generate descriptive statistics & explore trends.
##### Tasks:
Plot total cases over time for selected countries.
Plot total deaths over time.
Compare daily new cases between countries.
Calculate the death rate: total_deaths / total_cases.
##### Visualizations:
Line charts (cases & deaths over time).
Bar charts (top countries by total cases).
Heatmaps (optional for correlation analysis).
##### Tools:
matplotlib
seaborn

#### 5. Visualizing Vaccination Progress
Goal: Analyze vaccination rollouts.
##### Tasks:
Plot cumulative vaccinations over time for selected countries.
Compare % vaccinated population.
##### Charts:
Line charts.
Optional: Pie charts for vaccinated vs. unvaccinated.
##### Tools:
matplotlib
seaborn

#### 6. Optional: Build a Choropleth Map
Goal: Visualize cases or vaccination rates by country on a world map.
##### Tools:
Plotly Express
Or geopandas (advanced)
##### Tasks:
Prepare a dataframe with iso_code, total_cases for the latest date.
Plot a choropleth showing case density or vaccination rates.

#### 7. Insights & Reporting
Goal: Summarize findings.
##### Tasks:
- Write 3-5 key insights from the data (e.g., "X country had the fastest vaccine rollout").
- Highlight anomalies or interesting patterns.
- Use markdown cells in Jupyter Notebook to write your narrative.
##### Deliverables:
- A well-documented Jupyter Notebook combining:
- Code
- Visualizations
- Narrative explanations
- Optional export: Notebook → PDF or a PowerPoint with screenshots.
##### Recommended Tools:
- Jupyter Notebook (or VS Code with Jupyter extension)
- pandas
- matplotlib & seaborn
- Optional: plotly, geopandas
